# Apple Pie :apple:

In addition to the assignment, I added a start again button at the end of the game.

* This project is an iPad game called Apple Pie.
* It's a simple word-guessing game in which the player has a limited number of turns to guess the letters in a word.
* Each incorrect guess results in an apple falling of the tree.
* The player wins by guessing the word correclty before all the apples are gone.
